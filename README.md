# Assignment1-AP

You've been given a divide-and-conquer algorithm which merges k sorted lists recursively. Currently the time complexity of the algorithm is worst case O(k*N).
Your task is to change the recursion such that the time complexity decreases to worst case O(NLogk).
You can create a pull request, make changes and submit the changed code.
