# Assignment1-AP

You've been given a divide-and-conquer algorithm which merges k sorted lists recursively. Currently the time complexity of the algorithm is worst case O(kN).
Your task is to change the recursion such that the time complexity decreases to worst case O(kLogN).
You can create a pull request, make changes and submit the changed code.
